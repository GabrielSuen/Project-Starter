# CPSC 210 Personal Project

## Simple Game Project 

***What will the application do?***

The application centers around a simple game. The game revolves 
around two main elements: a platform, and a falling object. The
goal of the game is to land the falling object onto the platform.
Once accomplished the object will reset at the top of the screen 
and the platform will be located at a different place. The idea is
that as you continuously land the object on the platform, the speed
at which the object falls increases and you gain a point. I want 
to be able to record high scores into "profiles" which can save the 
state (level) a player is at. Furthermore I want to be able to 
compare player scores and see statistics on how likely it would be 
for one player to overtake the other in points.

***Who can use it?***

The game should have appropriate instructions and an easy to understand
interface that anyone can use. Additionally the game should be able
to be played with only a few keystrokes, accessible to any disabled 
or uncoordinated players.

***Why is this project of interest to you?***

This projects interests me as I've always enjoyed simple high-score
type games and I've relied on them to pass the time on many occasions
I thought it would be interesting to design my own and see what the
process is for making these types of games.

***User Stories***: 

As a user I want to...

- Be able to add new save profiles with a name and the recorded 
score (point count) 
- Be able to view a list of profiles and compare them on how likely
one player is to overtake the others score.
- Be able to choose a profile to "challenge", setting up their score
in the top left of the game screen. Once the player passes that
score, their score lights up
